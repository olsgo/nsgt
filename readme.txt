Mandatory dependencies:
-----------------------
Numerical Python (http://numpy.scipy.org) - version 1.20.0 or later

Python Requirements:
--------------------
Python 3.8 or later (tested up to Python 3.12)
Optimized for Apple Silicon (ARM64) processors

Optional dependencies:
-----------------------
PyFFTW3 (https://launchpad.net/pyfftw)
will greatly speed up the NSGT transformation if fftw3 is installed on your system

pysndfile (https://pypi.org/project/pysndfile)
is recommended for using the built-in audio import/streaming functionality (otherwise ffmpeg would be tried)


Installation:
-------------

Modern installation (recommended):
pip install nsgt

From source with modern build system:
python -m build
pip install dist/nsgt-*.whl

Traditional installation:
In the console (terminal application) change to the folder containing this readme.txt file.

To build the package run the following command:
python setup.py build

To install the package (with administrator rights):
sudo python setup.py install

Apple Silicon Optimization:
---------------------------
This package is optimized for Apple Silicon (ARM64) processors with:
- Native ARM64 compilation flags (-mcpu=apple-a14)
- Vectorized operations using Apple's SIMD capabilities
- Optimized Cython extensions when available

See APPLE_SILICON_OPTIMIZATION.md for detailed information.


Todo:
-----

- Quality measurement for coefficients of sliced transform
- Unify nsgfwin sliced/non-sliced
